# Tic-Tac-Toe

"You aren't a 'real developer' if you haven't built a Tic-Tac-Toe game."

The sentence that made this possible.

## The Story

After a friend challenged me with the classic "Tic-Tac-Toe Tutorial", I accepted the challenge. But why just build it? Why not use it as an opportunity to explore the "other side"?

**Why React?** Because I'm an Angular developer by day, and I had to get out of my comfort zone. This project is my exploration of React and Tailwind, focusing on the basics and leaving behind the "Angular way of thinking".
